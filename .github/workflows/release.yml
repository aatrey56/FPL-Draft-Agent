# Publishes a GitHub release when a version tag is pushed to `main`.
#
# The full structured changelog (breaking changes, environment impact, ecosystem
# effects) is generated separately by claude-changelog.yml when stage is merged
# into main. This workflow finalises the release draft created at that point.
#
# Tag format: v<major>.<minor>.<patch>  (e.g. v1.2.3)
# Only tags on `main` are considered production releases.
